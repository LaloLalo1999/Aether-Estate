## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.
-   A Cloudflare account and the [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) installed and configured.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/aether_estate.git
    cd aether_estate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses `bun` as the package manager.
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command starts the Vite development server for the frontend and the Wrangler server for the backend worker.
    ```sh
    bun run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application code, including pages, components, hooks, and styles.
-   `worker/`: Contains the backend Cloudflare Worker code, built with Hono. This includes API routes, entity definitions, and core Durable Object logic.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

The application is a full-stack monorepo running on a single development command.

-   **Frontend:** The frontend is a standard Vite + React application. All UI components are located in `src/components`, with pages in `src/pages`. Styling is done primarily with Tailwind CSS and pre-built `shadcn/ui` components.
-   **Backend:** The backend is a Hono application running on a Cloudflare Worker. API routes are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts`. Data persistence is handled by a single `GlobalDurableObject` which is abstracted away by `IndexedEntity` classes defined in `worker/entities.ts`.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is designed for seamless deployment to the Cloudflare network.

1.  **Build the project:**
    This command bundles the frontend application and the worker for production.
    ```sh
    bun run build
    ```

2.  **Deploy to Cloudflare:**
    This command deploys your application to your Cloudflare account using Wrangler.
    ```sh
    bun run deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy directly from your GitHub repository with a single click.
